# PoliAssembly
It's a program developer to check if your homework are right or wrong. In universities CS classes introduce students to assembly programming but not always this assembly exists, so Poliassembly would be a tool to verify if your program works. It's just an interpreter that also gives you the possibility to understand how the CPU works.

## Getting Started

You can just download the setup file from the website **[poli.iobii.com](https://poli.iobii.com)**, or ou can customize your own assembly interpreter cloneing this repository and eidt the visual studio project.
